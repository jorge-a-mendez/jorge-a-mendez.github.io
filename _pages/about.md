<span style="color:red">**I am recruting highly motivated PhD students to work with me starting Fall '25. If your research interests align with mine, please apply to the [ECE](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/electrical/graduate/admissions.php) or [CS](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/admissions/Graduate-Program) PhD program at Stony Brook.**</span>


I am an Assistant Professor of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.stonybrook.edu/electrical/) at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/). Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Learning &amp; Intelligent Systems Group](https://lis.csail.mit.edu) at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu), where I worked with [Prof. Tom&aacute;s Lozano-P&eacute;rez](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/) and [Prof. Leslie Pack Kaelbling](http://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/). I obtained my Ph.D. at the [Lifelong Machine Learning Group](https://lifelongml.seas.upenn.edu) at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://cis.upenn.edu), where I was advised by [Prof. Eric Eaton](https://seas.upenn.edu/~eeaton). I previously obtained a Master's degree in Robotics from the [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu) at Penn, and got my Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from [Universidad Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var](http://www.usb.ve) in Venezuela.

During my Ph.D., I was fortunate to work as a research intern in 2021 at FAIR NYC with [Arthur Szlam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u3-FxUgAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Ludovic Denoyer](https://ludc.github.io/video_games_and_deep_reinforcement_learning/) on mixture-of-experts models, in 2020 at MSR Montreal with Harm van Seijen on lifelong learning of compositional reinforcement learning problems, and in 2019 at Facebook AI with [Alborz Geramifard](http://alborz-geramifard.com/Homepage/Welcome.html) and [Mohammad Ghavamzadeh](https://mohammadghavamzadeh.github.io) on multidomain reinforcement learning for dialog. I previously spent a year at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.deib.polimi.it/eng/computer-science-and-engineering) in Italy, where I took graduate-level courses in AI and Robotics, and spent five months at the Advanced Systems Technology group in [STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com/).

Research Interests
-----

I'm interested in the creation of versatile, intelligent, embodied agents that learn to better interact with the world by accumulating knowledge over their lifetimes. I focus on the question of how these agents can leverage various forms of compositional and modular structures to transform the complex problem of modeling a lifelong data stream into simpler problems that can be more easily solved and whose solutions can be adapted, recombined, and reused in the future. My work mainly applies these methods to robotics, and also engages with related fields like computer vision and natural language.
