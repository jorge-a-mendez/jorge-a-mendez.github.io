abstract: ': A robot deployed in a home over long stretches of time faces a true lifelong learning problem. As it seeks to provide assistance to its users, the robot should leverage any accumulated experience to improve its own knowledge to become a more proficient assistant. We formalize this setting with a novel lifelong learning problem formulation in the context of learning for task and motion planning (TAMP). Exploiting the modularity of TAMP systems, we develop a generative mixture model that produces candidate continuous parameters for a planner. Whereas most existing lifelong learning approaches determine a priori how data is shared across task models, our approach learns shared and non-shared models and determines which to use online during planning based on auxiliary tasks that serve as a proxy for each modelâ€™s understanding of a state. Our method exhibits substantial improvements in planning success on simulated 2D domains and on several problems from the BEHAVIOR benchmark.'
